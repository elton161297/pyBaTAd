#The break Statement
#With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
#Exit the loop when i is 3:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
  
  
  
  #The else Statement
#With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

#Example
#Print a message once the condition is false:

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
